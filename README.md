# NYC_RIR
Dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j
 
Problem/Opportunity:
 
Life has been a total turn of even since the pandemic, especially when thinking of dining or ordering from a restaurant. As we know, restaurant inspections make sure that food served to the general public at licensed food establishments follows food safety guidelines. The dataset contains violation citations of these safety guidelines based on which the restaurants are graded score depending on violations, through every full or special program inspections conducted up to a few years before the foremost recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an energetic status on the record date in NYC. Hence, summing my question to, will there be a change in the selection of restaurants if people have a new rating system based on inspection results?
 
Goal:
 
The goal of the project is to come back up with such a specific analysis which will help people in selecting today’s or tonight’s restaurant for lunch or dinner considering the most recent inspection score together with the criticality of the violations supported inspection results. Since, we have already got a classification system supporting various factors just like the taste, quality, hospitality services, ambiance, and far more, this project is an initiative to vary the scoring system of the restaurant so as to ease the choice process supporting the inspection of the restaurants instead of the present factors. Considering all the attributes within the dataset, this project can bring changes within the restaurant rating industry by including the inspection results, also analyzing restaurants considering the geographic region which may help us understand a pattern and also the criticalities. Lastly, as per the aspects of the project, the duration will approximately cause two months including the research paper.
 
 
Objectives:

The first objective is to categorize all the restaurant’s score, violation code and critical flag based on the cuisine, inspection date and boro for location. 
The second objective is to find a geographical pattern to health code violations based on above categorization through EDA and visualizations.
The third objective is to perform cumulative analytics presented in a new way of selecting a restaurant in the vicinity to enjoy hygienic food . 



 Success Criteria:

The success of this project is when this analysis will be used to bring a new rating system other than the existing one, which will include the analysis from the inspection results helping the customers to trust a restaurant with the level of hygiene that is expected from the customers, during and post pandemic. 

 
Assumptions, Risks, Obstacles:
 
The obstacles of missing scores or violation code in the data set can lead to improper analysis of the restaurant’s rating system based on inspection results. The risk taken here will be cleaning and elimination of null of missing values. Assuming, the cleaning process to be a clear slate, can help the analysis to be successful and give an entire new rating system based on inspection results helping the customers to find the most hygienic restaurant to eat.
